    <p>I've never enjoyed basketball as much as when I watch the Warriors. Sure you might call me a bandwagon fan, but I'd argue, I lived there for 2 years and my local team was a success, why not!</p>
    <p>Watching roughly 8 guys mix in and out on the court completing assists, dunks and some awesome long shots is exciting and fun! There's nothing like raising your arm over an over as you celebrate 3's with these amazing shooters!</p>
    <p>Established in 1946 in Philly, the team finally made their way West in 1962 as the San Francisco Warrors. in '71 they became the Golden State Warriors, going short as the Dubs. Their most recent championship in 2015 came after 40 years since the previous. Team is up for it again this year, will they pull it off?
        <p>If you haven't watched them, you need to! Catch them in the playoffs as they prepare to take on all!</p>
